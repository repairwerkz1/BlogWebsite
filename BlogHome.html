<h1>Welcome To My Blog site!</h1>
<p>Thanks for dropping by! I want  to say I hope that you  enjoy  our content and come in the future. I have been involved in different  aspects of IT from coding in COBOL and RPG to supporting live NFL shows like Good Morning Football and Game Day Live.  My goal is to show you what goes into supporting technology on a show or event.  Working with different users from Executives, NFL talent and  our NFL staff. Enjoy while I share my experiences!</p>
